# Logic Gate Neural Network

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a neural network to learn the XOR logic gate using PyTorch. The notebook includes:
- Definition of the neural network model.
- Preparation of the dataset.
- Training the model.
- Visualising the decision boundary.
- An interactive interface using Gradio to test the model.

## Files
- `logic_gate_nn.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with the complete implementation and interactive interface.
- `logic_gate_nn_report.md`: A brief report explaining the model architecture, training process, and results.
- `sub.py`: Python script for visualization using Gradio.

## How to Run
1. Open the `logic_gate_nn.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run all cells to train the model and visualize the decision boundary.
3. The last cell will launch the Gradio interface, allowing you to test the model with custom inputs.

## Visualisation
The interactive visualisation can be demonstrated using the provided Jupyter Notebook file: [logic_gate_nn.ipynb](logic_gate_nn.ipynb).

## Results
The neural network successfully learned the XOR logic gate, with the decision boundary plot illustrating how the model separates the input space into two regions, corresponding to the XOR output values.
